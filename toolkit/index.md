# AI Toolkit

## Lowering the Entry Barrier to Software Architecture Excellence

The sophisticated architectural patterns in the Ubi framework traditionally require deep expertise in domain-driven design, event-driven systems, and distributed architecture. This expertise remains scarce and expensive, limiting architectural excellence to elite teams while most organizations struggle with ad-hoc approaches that accumulate technical debt.

## AI-Powered Accessibility

The Ubi AI Toolkit significantly reduces the entry barrier to sophisticated architectural patterns. AI agents that understand the meta-language and framework patterns can implement proven architectural solutions consistently, without requiring years of specialized experience.

**Key Advantages:**

- **Meta-Language Understanding**: AI translates behavioral specifications directly into technical implementations
- **Opinionated Standardization**: Implements proven patterns rather than solving arbitrary architecture problems
- **Pattern Consistency**: Ensures architectural decisions align with framework principles across teams

This approach raises the baseline quality of software architecture across organizations, making excellence accessible to teams regardless of their current expertise level.](<# AI Toolkit

## Toolkit Architecture

The Ubi AI Toolkit operates as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** that integrates with commercial AI clients and development environments. The toolkit provides domain-aware AI agents that understand both the Ubi framework patterns and domain-driven design principles, enabling intelligent guidance throughout the specification and implementation process.

**Integration Modes**:
- **CLI Access**: Direct command-line integration for developer workflows
- **MCP Server**: Integration with commercial AI clients like Claude and development tools
- **Standalone Application**: Web-based interface for collaborative specification sessions

## Core Capabilities

### Interactive Specification Creation

**Lifecycle Builder**: Conversational specification development through guided AI assistance.

The `lifecycle_builder` prompt launches interactive sessions where the Ubi Assistant guides users through creating complete lifecycle specifications for aggregates. The assistant combines framework knowledge with domain-driven design expertise to:

- Ask targeted questions that uncover business rules and edge cases
- Interpret user input and translate business requirements into structured specifications
- Ensure proper aggregate boundary definition and behavioral completeness
- Generate validated YAML lifecycle specifications that capture complete business behavior

**Business Documentation Generation**: Transform specifications into stakeholder-ready documentation.

Once lifecycle specifications are complete, the assistant generates comprehensive business documentation using the `generate_business_docs` tool:

- **Business Summary**: Human-readable narrative describing aggregate purpose and lifecycle flow
- **Detailed Specifications**: User stories and Given-When-Then scenarios for stakeholder validation
- **Traceability Documentation**: Clear connections between business requirements and technical specifications

### Executable Specification Development

**Executable Specification Builder**: Transform descriptive specifications into testable implementations.

The `lifecycle_specs_builder` prompt takes validated lifecycle specifications as input and guides users through creating executable specifications for each command. The process ensures:

- **Command-by-Command Coverage**: Systematic generation of executable specifications for complete lifecycle coverage
- **Interactive Refinement**: User review and adjustment of programmatic assertions before finalization
- **TypeScript/Jest Integration**: Executable specifications using familiar testing frameworks and type-safe assertions

**Automated Implementation Generation**: Generate working code from executable specifications.

The assistant uses the `implement` tool to produce:

- **Jest Test Suites** (`.spec.ts`): Comprehensive test cases that validate decider behavior against specifications
- **Decider Implementation** (`.decider.ts`): Functional implementation using the ts-decider library patterns
- **Type-Safe Interfaces**: Proper TypeScript interfaces for Decision Models and Outcome Models

### ts-decider Library Integration

The toolkit includes the **ts-decider** library that provides standardized implementation patterns for the decider architecture:

**Functional Programming Patterns**: Pure function implementations that ensure predictable, testable business logic
**Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for Decision Models, Outcome Models, and event structures
**Framework Consistency**: Standardized patterns that align with Ubi architectural principles across projects
**Testing Integration**: Built-in support for specification-driven test generation and validation

## Advanced Workflows

### Atlassian Integration (In Development)

**End-to-End Project Management**: Complete integration with enterprise project management workflows.

The Atlassian workflow bridges specification creation with project delivery:

1. **Interactive Specification Development**: Guided creation of lifecycle specifications through AI assistance
2. **Confluence Documentation**: Automatic upload of business summaries and specifications to Confluence for stakeholder review
3. **Jira Task Management**: Automated creation of development tasks for each command, including user stories and acceptance criteria
4. **Implementation Pipeline**: Optional continuation through executable specification generation and code implementation with human approval gates

**Human-in-the-Loop Automation**: Rather than fully automated generation, the workflow emphasizes human oversight at critical decision points, ensuring AI assistance enhances professional judgment without replacing it.

### Comprehensive Layer Implementation (In Development)

**Inbox Specification Generation**: Conversational design of command processing pipelines.

Interactive sessions guide users through defining complete Inbox layer requirements:
- Command reception and validation strategies
- Guard evaluation and security patterns  
- State hydration and external service integration
- Composable step pipeline configuration

Generated artifacts include Inbox specifications, comprehensive tests, and complete implementation following framework patterns.

**Outbox Specification Generation**: Guided design of event publishing and integration patterns.

Conversational sessions help users define Outbox processing requirements:
- Event classification and enrichment strategies
- Publishing patterns and delivery guarantees
- Integration with messaging infrastructure
- Error handling and reliability policies

Generated artifacts include Outbox specifications, test suites covering reliability scenarios, and complete implementation with proper transactional patterns.
