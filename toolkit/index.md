# AI Toolkit

## Lowering the Entry Barrier to Software Architecture Excellence

The sophisticated architectural patterns in the Ubi framework traditionally require deep expertise in domain-driven design, event-driven systems, and distributed architecture. This expertise remains scarce and expensive, limiting architectural excellence to elite teams while most organizations struggle with ad-hoc approaches that accumulate technical debt.

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Tools build intelligently on each other's outputs

## Core Tool Categories

### Foundation Tools: Smart Aggregate Design

**Aggregate Boundary Analysis**: Intelligent decomposition of complex business requirements.

The `analyze_aggregate_boundaries` tool prevents common design mistakes by analyzing user intent and recommending proper aggregate boundaries using DDD principles. When users describe broad systems like "order management," the tool guides them toward focused aggregates like ShoppingCart, OrderProcessing, and Payment with clear responsibilities and communication patterns.

**Domain Pattern Recognition**: Industry-specific expertise for faster specification development.

The `analyze_domain_patterns` tool provides deep domain knowledge for specific industries (e-commerce, healthcare, finance), suggesting common operations, security requirements, compliance patterns, and architectural recommendations. This ensures specifications align with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.

**Incremental Operation Building**: Systematic development of complex business operations.

The `build_operation_incrementally` tool guides users through designing complete operations using progressive analysis. The tool systematically analyzes security requirements, business preconditions, branching logic, and outcome assertions to generate comprehensive operation specifications that handle real-world complexity.

### Generation Tools: Executable Implementation

**Lifecycle to Implementation Pipeline**: Complete automation from specifications to working code.

The generation tools transform YAML specifications into production-ready implementations through sampling-based analysis:

- **`generate_assertions`**: Converts lifecycle business rules into executable implementation specifications with precise validation logic
- **`generate_types`**: Creates comprehensive TypeScript type definitions with validation patterns and business rule constraints  
- **`generate_decider`**: Produces complete business logic implementations using the **ubi-decider** library with full type safety and functional programming patterns
- **`generate_tests`**: Generates comprehensive test suites covering all business scenarios, failure cases, and edge conditions

Each generation tool uses iterative sampling to ensure quality, consistency, and completeness while maintaining alignment with business specifications.

### ubi-decider Library Integration

The toolkit generates implementations using the **ubi-decider** library, which provides the foundational patterns for the decider architecture:

**Functional Programming Patterns**: Pure function implementations for preconditions, branches, and evolutions that ensure predictable, testable business logic without side effects.

**Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces including `TDecider`, `DecisionModel`, `OutcomeModel`, and strongly-typed command/event structures that prevent runtime errors.

**Framework Consistency**: Standardized implementation patterns that align with Ubi architectural principles, ensuring consistency across projects and teams.

**Testing Integration**: Built-in support for specification-driven test generation with proper typing for decision models and outcome validation.

### Validation Tools: Quality Assurance

**Drift Detection**: Automated consistency validation across specification files.

The `validate_drift` tool analyzes all aggregate files (lifecycle.yaml, assertions.yaml, types.ts, decider.ts) to identify inconsistencies and provide specific fix recommendations. This prevents the common problem of specifications and implementations diverging over time.

**Test Coverage Analysis**: Comprehensive validation of business scenario coverage.

The `test_coverage_analysis` tool ensures test suites cover all business requirements by analyzing specifications against generated tests, identifying missing scenarios, and providing specific test case recommendations.

## Intelligent Workflow Orchestration

### Context-Rich Sampling

The toolkit employs **context-rich sampling** that preserves the architectural wisdom of the framework while adding AI intelligence:

- **Foundation Analysis**: Each tool maintains deep understanding of DDD principles, meta-language concepts, and proven patterns
- **Progressive Refinement**: Tools make multiple focused LLM calls to build understanding iteratively
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation ensures outputs meet framework standards
- **Pattern Preservation**: All generated code follows established architectural patterns

### Conversational Design Process

**Interactive Lifecycle Design**: Natural language specification development with intelligent guidance.

The design conversation begins with boundary analysis and domain expertise, then flows naturally through operation design with real-time tool assistance. The AI assistant proactively suggests tools when they would add value, creating a collaborative experience that feels like working with an expert architect.

**Automatic Progression**: Seamless transition from design to implementation.

Once lifecycle specifications are complete, the assistant guides users through the generation pipeline, suggesting the next logical steps and ensuring proper dependencies between generated artifacts.

## Advanced Capabilities

### Collaborative Domain Modeling Integration

**Optimal Workflow**: Post-EventStorming formalization and implementation bridge.

The Ubi AI Toolkit achieves maximum value when integrated with collaborative domain modeling techniques such as **EventStorming**, **domain modeling sessions**, or **OOPSI workshops**. When teams have already identified the big picture through collaborative exploration and agreed on solution design, the toolkit serves as the perfect bridge to formalize that knowledge into precise specifications and transform them into production-ready implementations.

This collaborative-to-executable workflow ensures:
- **Shared Understanding**: Business and technical stakeholders align on domain knowledge before specification
- **Design Validation**: Collaborative sessions reveal edge cases and business rules that inform comprehensive specifications  
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Workshop outcomes become permanent, executable artifacts
- **Implementation Fidelity**: Technical implementation perfectly reflects collaborative design decisions

**Standalone Strategic Guidance**: Comprehensive design assistance when collaborative modeling is not available.

When collaborative domain modeling sessions are not feasible, the toolkit provides extensive guidance to ensure software output remains strategic and well-designed:

- **Aggregate Boundary Analysis**: Prevents common design mistakes through systematic DDD principle application
- **Domain Pattern Recognition**: Applies industry expertise to ensure specifications follow proven patterns
- **Modular Design Principles**: Guides users toward maintainable, loosely-coupled architectures
- **Business Rule Completeness**: Systematic analysis ensures comprehensive coverage of business scenarios

The toolkit's foundation tools ensure that even individual developers can produce enterprise-grade architectural designs by following structured guidance and proven patterns.

## Strategic Value
