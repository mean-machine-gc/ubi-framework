# SDLC Model

## Flexible Software Delivery for the AI Era

The Ubi SDLC model recognizes that software delivery excellence requires adaptability to organizational realities while maintaining rigorous design principles. Rather than prescribing a single methodology, the framework provides multiple pathways that converge on the same architectural outcomes: well-designed, specification-driven systems that leverage AI capabilities effectively.

**The central principle: software design and development remain at the core of delivery success, supported by processes that enhance rather than constrain engineering excellence.**

## The Collaborative Ideal

For organizations ready to embrace collaborative modeling practices, the Ubi SDLC follows a systematic progression from business understanding to working systems.

### Phase 1: Collaborative Discovery

**EventStorming Big Picture**: Cross-functional teams explore the business domain through facilitated modeling sessions that reveal:

- Business processes and their temporal relationships
- Key business events and their triggers
- Actor responsibilities and system boundaries
- Pain points and improvement opportunities

**Process Modeling**: Deep-dive sessions focus on critical business processes to understand:

- Detailed workflow sequences and decision points
- Information requirements and data flows
- Exception handling and edge cases
- Integration points with external systems

**Software Design**: Collaborative transition from business understanding to technical architecture:

- Bounded context identification and definition
- Aggregate design based on transactional boundaries
- Event flow modeling for cross-context integration
- Module structure aligned with business processes

### Phase 2: Specification Creation

**Interactive Specification Development**: Teams use the Ubi toolkit to transform collaborative insights into formal specifications:

- Lifecycle specifications for identified aggregates
- Policy specifications for reactive business rules
- Process specifications for complex workflows
- Business documentation for stakeholder validation

**Quality Validation**: Specifications undergo review for:

- Business alignment with collaborative modeling outcomes
- Architectural consistency with framework principles
- Completeness of behavioral coverage
- Clarity for both business and technical stakeholders

### Phase 3: AI-Assisted Implementation

**Executable Specification Generation**: Transform descriptive specifications into testable implementations:

- Command-by-command executable specification development
- Programmatic assertion creation for business rule validation
- Test suite generation with comprehensive coverage
- Implementation scaffolding aligned with architectural patterns

**Iterative Development**: Specification-driven development cycles that maintain business alignment:

- Code generation from executable specifications
- Continuous validation against business requirements
- Incremental delivery with stakeholder feedback integration
- Architecture evolution guided by changing business needs

### Phase 4: Continuous Validation

**Living Documentation**: Specifications serve as authoritative sources that evolve with business requirements:

- Automated synchronization between specifications and implementation
- Business documentation updates reflecting system changes
- Stakeholder validation of specification modifications
- Architectural decision tracking and rationale preservation

## Practical Entry Points

Recognizing that many organizations operate within existing constraints, the Ubi SDLC provides alternative starting points that achieve the same architectural outcomes through different pathways.

### Business Documentation Entry

**Starting Point**: Organizations that begin with traditional business requirements documentation can leverage Ubi specifications to improve design quality.

**Process Flow**:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Existing business requirements are analyzed and translated into Ubi specification format
2. **Specification Creation**: Business analysts work with the Ubi toolkit to create formal behavioral specifications
3. **Architectural Review**: Experienced architects validate that specifications represent sound aggregate and modular design
4. **Implementation Planning**: Specifications drive development planning and resource allocation

**Hidden Benefits**: Teams unknowingly develop domain-driven design skills through specification creation, learning aggregate thinking and bounded context concepts without explicit DDD training.

### Legacy System Entry

**Starting Point**: Organizations with existing systems that need modernization or AI integration.

**Process Flow**:

1. **System Analysis**: Existing system behavior is reverse-engineered into Ubi specifications
2. **Gap Identification**: Current implementation is compared against ideal specification-driven design
3. **Incremental Improvement**: Targeted improvements using Ubi patterns for high-impact areas
4. **Gradual Migration**: Systematic replacement of legacy components with specification-driven implementations

**Strategic Value**: Enables gradual system improvement without disruptive rewrites while building team capability in modern design practices.

### Greenfield Project Entry

**Starting Point**: New projects that can adopt Ubi practices from inception.

**Process Flow**:

1. **Domain Analysis**: Business requirements are captured directly as Ubi specifications
2. **Architectural Planning**: Specifications inform module structure and integration patterns
3. **AI-Enhanced Development**: Full leverage of toolkit capabilities for rapid, high-quality implementation
4. **Evolutionary Architecture**: System design that anticipates change through specification-driven flexibility

**Competitive Advantage**: Enables rapid delivery of sophisticated systems with built-in AI integration and maintainable architecture.
